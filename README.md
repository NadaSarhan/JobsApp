# JobsApp

What I did:

- Use this API to get the jobs.
https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?description=api

- The user is welcomed on the first screen with the message “Welcome to Mega
Trust Jobs”. And start button.

- When the user click on the start button he should navigate to the jobs screen
Which display a list of jobs, the list item should display the following info
(company name, company logo, job title , Star icon if the user add the job to
favorite).

-  implemented in Kotlin.

- use MVI architecture

I face an exception with RoomDB I will try to solve the exceptions even after sending this mail(not to miss the deadline) 
Can you send me a feedback about the code so i can learn more.
